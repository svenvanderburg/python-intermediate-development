# Note for using slides

Some quick information about how to use the slides when delivering the course.

The slides themselves are written in Jupyter notebooks, which have the built-in capability to produce slides. At the moment, the final HTML version of slides is not included, so you need to have Jupyter installed in order to render them. A virtual environment with a subsequent `pip` command is recommended to "run" the slides:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv  # it is important to use the dot prefix if you are creating this at the top level of this repo
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install jupyter
# launch jupyter from the top level of this repo, **not** in the slide
# directory or else the relative figure links won't work
jupyter-notebook
# navigate to the slide file and edit
```

There are a few options for accessing these slides in a slideshow view.

1. Use the RISE extension to Jupyter. This allows you to enter the slideshow from the Jupyter notebook web interface. Probably most helpful if you are editing the slides and want to see effects realtime. Get RISE: `pip install rise`. And then there will be a new button on the Jupyter notebook toolbar (you might need to go to the 'View' menu to get the toolbar to show).
  - Use spacebar to advance slides. Presenter view with `t`.
2. Use `nbconvert` and run a server: `jupyter nbconvert --to slides rough_notes.ipynb --post serve`. That should open up in your browser automatically, or provide a link to do so.
  - Arrow keys to advance slides. Presenter view with `s`
3. A more involved option if you don't have an internet connection (this is the only instance I can see this option being useful) is to link the above command with your local reveal.js installation. I lost the page where this command is :(

When the slides need to link to the course content, they assume the pages are hosted locally at `0.0.0.0:4000`. This is the default location where `make docker-serve` puts the website if you have build locally from this repo. The decision was made to link locally rather than too the live website to allow for local modifications of the content.

## Screen Arrangement for Remote Delivery

- Screen 1
  - if there is a size difference in your screens, this should be the largest one
  - shared with participants
  - web browser with jupyter-notebook for current section open, `alt-r` to get presentation view, then `t` to get presenter view window which should be put on screen 2
    - tab with course content page
    - tab with GitHub repo of example project
  - PyCharm with example project open
  - Terminal with current directory in example project
- Screen 2
  - smaller, not shared
  - terminal running jupyter-notebook server for slides
  - presenter view (produced from going to presenter view above)
  - Zoom window
  - Web browser
    - workshop website
    - course content
    - collaborative document
    - any other resources you think you might need to refer to
  - messaging app for communication with helpers
